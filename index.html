    <h1> My 1st Information and Technology Class</h1>
    <h1 class="Info">
            At first, I expect on this class that we're just talking about Internet
        things not going deep but my it goes beyond my expectation. We talk about a 
        different field where ICT improved the way it is used it gets
        easier the way it works and more efficient. 
        <br>
        The first is education with help of technologies it brings us easy access 
        to the information you can learn whatever your situation you're in
        you just needed to have Internet. Almost everywhere in the world get in touch 
        with other people in just one click send messages even if your friend locate on 
        another part of the earth. The other thing is Commerce It's like an online mall 
        that you can buy anything just by surfing on their apps, you don't need to go to
        on designated location to shopping and get tired of that. It brings light too to 
        Visual arts, artists either become digital artists or traditional artists in a 
        digital artist it makes the expenses minimum because you don't need to buy materials
        It helps us too in Health services it make effectively diagnose and treat patients on
        the modern way and many fields, it's like all the field get affected by technologies.
        <br>
        Furthermore, I learn in this class is the different types of website
        like web 1.0 a static page that a user is just can read on it and can't interact 
        with the host and obtain more information. The other one is Web 2.0, In this Web 
        2.0, it's written using dynamic programming languages that it easy to share other 
        things and your opinions over the web. It's become interactive. Web 3.0 in its name 
        it's more modern than others it's referred to as semantic web As the user interacts or 
        responds, contributes, and collaborates on the web, the context of the search of the user 
        is processed by a programming language to help the user by presenting options of what the person is interested.
        <br>
        In this class too we make a resume in word and formula on getting the grades in 
        excel and make a presentation in PowerPoint. It teaches us too about graphics and layout
        and Image manipulation, and why design is important. It teaches us many things like how 
        to balance a picture, alignment and hierarchy, contrast, rhythm, proximity, and color 
        and space in an image. and how to manipulate images. We make things too like a website
        using Wix, we learned how to make a simple website using Wix how to make it responsive and attractive.
        <br>
            The important part of it is it teaches us how to be a responsible
        digital citizen. And on how to use ICT as a platform for change or social change developing
        and project for social change to inform others and what need to do to change the way its 
        works. The last things it teaches us is on how to maintain traffic on ICT project for social
        change, and how to monitor social impact of advocacies.
